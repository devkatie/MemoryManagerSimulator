# MemoryManagerSimulator
Memory Manager Simulator for SJC's COM 310 Project 2

The Memory Manager Simulator uses the Best Fit, Worst Fit, and First Fit memory allocation algorithms to simulate how processes in memory
are handled by a computer.  

For the purposes of this simulation, maximum memory size has been limited to 9999KB and the maximum number of unique processes has been set to 12.  There is no upper limit to the waiting queue.  Processes in the waiting queue are added automatically, as space allows, during compaction.
